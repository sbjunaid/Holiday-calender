## 🚀 What Took the Longest? 
Two things almost made me lose my mind:  
1. **Solving API Endpoints:** Debugging how the frontend communicates with the backend, structuring routes, and handling data properly took hours.  
2. **CORS Errors (My Worst Nightmare 😭):**  
   - Locally, everything worked fine.  
   - Deployment? BOOM 💥 CORS errors ruined my life.  
   - After endless debugging, tweaking headers, using Postman, and searching StackOverflow, I finally fixed it.  

---

## 💡 What I Learned
- The **flow of a full-stack project**: How the frontend sends requests, how the backend processes them, and how data is stored/retrieved from the DB.  
- **Debugging APIs using Postman** helped a lot.  
- Handling **CORS issues** (and suffering through it 😅).  
- Deploying different services on **Cloudflare (Frontend)** and **Railway (Backend)** and making them work together.  
- MongoDB Atlas for **NoSQL storage**.

## 🔗 Resources That Saved My Life 
- **Stack Overflow (Endless debugging)**  
- **Postman (Testing APIs like a boss)**  
- **Google**, because where else would I go? 😂

## 🍽️ Fun Fact
This project made me realise sometimes debugging can make you happy. ... **pure happiness**. 🤩  

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
Even though I did a full-stack project before, doing it with **two different languages** for frontend and backend was a next-level challenge.  
This project taught me **a hell lot**, and I’m proud of it! 🚀

🔥 **Thanks for checking this out!** If you’re dealing with CORS errors, stay strong. You’ll get through it. 😆
